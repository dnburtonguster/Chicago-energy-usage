(self-directed data modeling project from early 2015)

###Data
The data for this exploratory prediction of the variability of energy consumption by
residential buildings in Chicago comes from the [energy usage 2010 dataset](https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?limitTo=datasets).
The exercise was a self-directed task used to come up with a hypothesis based on some readily-available factors
(ie. block population, occupancy, physical houseing, gas/electricity usage, etc.). 

###Angles/Assumptions/Approach
* How skeptical would I be of my own findings?
* What approach would I take? Would I pivot?
* How well am I internalizing the nuances of the data, and where will it lead me?
* How quickly could I begin to notice trends and highly-correlated variables? (how quick to the drivers/movers?)
